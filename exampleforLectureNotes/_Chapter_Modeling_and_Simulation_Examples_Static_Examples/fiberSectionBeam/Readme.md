The model of a cantilever RC beam (displacement-based beam element with fiber section), 
subjected to both force-controlled and displacement-controlled pushover.
This was part of the sensitivity study conducted to determine the element discretization
(this example reports the case of 1 element).
The main file (RCcolumnPush.fei) recalls two external files:
1. ColumnSection.fei in which the cross-section is defined and
2. Push_m.txt, with the input curve for the pushover
