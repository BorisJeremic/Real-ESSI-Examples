This folder contains verification cases for the implementation of inclined plane wave field. 

uniform folder contains verification cases for uniform geology profile. 

uniform folder contains three subfolders (poisson_ratio, shear_wave_velocity and SW4) to test the simulation accuracy of different poisson's ratios, shear wave velocities and compare with finite difference result of SW4. 

The standard case of verification for uniform ground profile is: 

frequency: 5Hz

inclination: 60 degrees

magnitude: 2m^2

Three layers ground profile: 

first layer: thickness 50m, Vs 750m/s, poisson ratio 0.3, density 2300 kg/m^3; 

second layer: thickness 100m, Vs 750m/s, poisson ratio 0.3, density 2300 kg/m^3; 

third layer: thicknesss infinity, Vs 750m/s, poisson ratio 0.3, density 2300 kg/m^3; 


layering folder contains verification cases for layering geology profile. 

The layering folfer contains two subfolders (frequency and inclination) to test the simulation accuracy of different frequencies and different inclinations. 

The standard case of verification for layering ground is:

frequency: 5Hz

inclination: 60 degrees

magnitude: 2m^2
